## COIN MINER GAME
Coin Miner Game is an only IOS school project I've decided to update and revamp. Originally being a small game with static sprites, I've made changes to give the game 
more movement and more styalized (even if its style is a bit rough).

# Additions
<ul>
  <li> Player animations - Idle, movement, actions </li>
  <li> revamped procedural generation </li>
  <li> dedicated shop screen </li>
  <li> more mineable materials </li>
  <li> a psuedo crafting system with more animations </li>
  <li> dedicated house screen for crafting </li>
  <li> fully remade sprites to be a bit brighter and sillier </li>
</ul>

# Install

To just play on a macOS machine all you need to do is install the repository and run the game in XCode's emulator <br>

However, to load onto an IOS device (phone recommended) follow basic protocall for loading applications: <br>
